# C-Algo
Generic programming C-Style 

Opaque pointer (pimpl idiom) that separates C interfaces with implementation; like information hiding in C++ (see C Interfaces and Implementations, Hansen).

Ranged base algorithms
sort, binsearch, transform, modify any type of data type, using the qsort and STL patterns.  Many functors are provided in functors.h and the test functions show how to use them.

Data structures that use a static memory allocator (by Jacob Edner, Jonathan Valvano) for systems (embedded) that do not like dynamic allocation.
array, hashtable binary tree, (including delete tree node), circular list to be used for thread control blocks
